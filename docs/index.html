<h1>Pyro 4.0 manual</h1>
<p>The manual still needs to be written.</p>
<p>For the time being, maybe the old <a href="http://irmen.home.xs4all.nl/pyro3/manual/PyroManual.html">Pyro 3.x manual</a> is helpful.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.razorvine.net/projects/Pyro/">development pages on Pyro 4</a>.</p>

Introduction.
Introduce the basic Pyro features by means of a simple example.
Describe the setup of a simple example (server, client, using nameserver).
Show the code for a non-Pyro version.
Show how to use Pyro to make it remote.
Show how to do it without a name server.
Little bit of history? (how Pyro came to be, Pyro 3, Pyro4)   
</p>
<p>
Features.
Very fast overview of all the features Pyro provides:

- written in 100% Python so extremely portable.
- support for all Python datatypes that are pickleable.
- runs in normal CPython 2.x, CPython 3.x, IronPython, jython. Not tested with Pypy yet.
- works between systems on different architectures (64-bit, 32-bit, Intel, PowerPC...)
- designed to be very easy to use and get out of your way as much as possible.
- remote exceptions will be raised in the caller, as if they were local. You can extract detailed remote traceback information.
- name server that keeps track of your object's actual locations so you can move them around transparently.
- support for automatic reconnection to servers in case of interruptions.
- one-way invocations for enhanced performance.
- batched invocations for greatly enhanced performance of many calls on the same object.
- many simple examples included to show various features and techniques.
- large amount of unit tests and fairly high test coverage.
- built upon more than 10 years of previous Pyro versions.
- stable and heavily tested network communication code that works reliably on many platforms.

<p>
Installation and configuration.

Pyro is on Pypi (package name Pyro4) Installation via easy_install or pip.
Or run the setup.py script manually.

Pyro installs as the 'Pyro4' package with a couple of sub modules that you usually don't need to access directly.

Configuration.
Config items in Pyro.config.
Can set them in code.
Can set them as environment vars, use PYRO_ prefix.
Describe each config item.

<p>
Security.
Warning about exposing Pyro over the internet.
By default, Pyro only uses the local loopback network. You have to explicitly tell it to expose and use ports on remotely accessible interface.
HMAC signature to prevent malicious request packets. Need to set it yourself with a secure shared key, will give warning if left unenabled.
No encryption! (yet)
Dotted names are disallowed by default because they are a security vulnerability
    (for similar reasons as described here http://www.python.org/news/security/PSF-2005-001/ ).
